# Mobile App to walk the Trail of Sultans

## Description

Application for the mobile or tablet to walk an ancient trail which was strolled (by boat actually) by the sultan Suleiman long time ago.

## Documentation

The question is; 'Why making another application which shows maps, like so many other apps do'? It is done because this application shows information which makes it different from others. I'll try to point this out in the list below;

* The program is **not** a general purpose app showing maps and recording tracks. It shows tracks and routes of one specific trail with historic and cultural information along the route.
* The app is targeted to an audience of walkers and bikers(?). The app will therefore try to provide information only for this audience to follow the route and a helping hand along e.g. POI are provided to find restaurants, places to sleep and tourist information wherever possible.
* The app should be able to show maps when not in a WiFi zone. This means that the maps are downloaded upon first start and that the user must be in a WIFI zone.
* Tracks are automatically recorded after loading a track and saved when program is closed.
* When the network is available it should be possible;
  * to make reservations at hotels, B & B, restaurants etc using the POI on the map. Clicking on such a link brings them to a website, e.g. booking.com.
  * When signal is good enough map updates could also be possible.
  * Recorded tracks can be shared by uploading a track to a server. The user can setup a group of users who will be informed when the track is uploaded.
