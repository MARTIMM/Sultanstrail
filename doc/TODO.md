## Replace jquery library with closure

Looking around and being a bit unhappy with the jquery mobile ui I saw this answer on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1690197/what-does-google-closure-library-offer-over-jquery) on the question 'What does Google Closure Library offer over jQuery?' and [here](https://github.com/google/closure-library/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) is also a good text in FAQ.

Summarized it comes down to;
  * its an ecosystem that has tools to optimize and minimize the code as well as for debugging this code
  * documentation is good
  * basic features: events, ui, online state, history, ajax etc
  * templates
  * easy to use
  * dynamic loading of modules
  * geared towards collaborative development and maintanence of complex JavaScript applications
  * emphasizes object-oriented style programming, namespacing, dependency declaration, type checking, interfaces, and encapsulation

Other reasons for change are;
  * not happy with jquery mobile ui
  * openlayers mentions it
